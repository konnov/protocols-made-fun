        <p> If you want to pick up my brain for a few hours, <a
        href="javascript:location.href = 'mailto:' + ['igor','konnov.phd'].join('@')"
        aria-label="email">drop me an email.</a> After that, we can switch to a
        messenger of your choice (e.g., Signal, Telegram, or others) or have a call. For
        short consultations, I accept payments via Stripe. I also consider longer-term
        engagements (from weeks to months), which would require a contract. You can see
        my portfolio at <a href="https://konnov.phd">konnov.phd</a>. I am based in
        Austria (CET/CEST) and have experience working with clients from the US, UK, and
        EU.  </p>

        <p>Why contact me instead of a big-name company like XYZ? Here’s why:</p>

        <ul class="spaced-list">
          <li><b>You know exactly who's doing the work</b>. If you hire me, I
          do the work.  With large firms, you never know who's behind the
          scenes. Sometimes it's an expert. Other times, it's a ghost worker hired
          as a subcontractor. (I know that, since I was offered this kind of work.)
          If we need a larger team, I also can recommend a few people who I
          personally know and trust.</li>
          
          <li><b>If we're not a fit, I'll tell you</b>. If we can't agree on the
          timeline or budget, I won't waste your time. I'll gladly refer you to
          someone I trust who can get the job done.</li>
          
          <li><b>No hidden costs</b> There's no budget drain going to managers,
          marketers, sales teams, their friends, or overhead. What you pay goes
          directly to the person doing the work. While my hourly rate might seem
          higher than a salaried employee's, it's often a fraction of what an
          agency would charge for the same results.</li>
          
          <li><b>Quick and clear value</b>. I prefer short, focused engagements
          to get you exactly what you need. If things go well and we're both
          happy, we continue.</li>
        </ul>
