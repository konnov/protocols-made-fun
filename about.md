Keep hearing about PMF from your manager and you don't know what it is? In this
blog, PMF is about protocols and fun, even if your manager tells you
that PMF means "Product-Market Fit".

This is [Igor Konnov][my website]'s blog about protocol specification, testing,
and verification. Licensed under [CC BY 4.0][] :recycle:. I am an independent
security and formal methods researcher, having a [track record][] in academia
and the blockchain industry. If you need help with your distributed protocols or
smart contracts, check [my website][]. In case you need more than a soloist for
your task, we can easily build a research team with [Andrey Kuprianov][],
[Thomas Pani][], and [Jure Kukovec][], as we did in the past.
