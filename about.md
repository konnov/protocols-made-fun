This is [Igor Konnov][website]'s blog about protocol specification, testing, and
verification. Licensed under [CC BY 4.0][] :recycle:. I am an independent
security and formal methods researcher, having a [track record][] in academia
and industry.

Not sure your distributed protocol or smart contracts are solid?  [Check out my

<p> If you want to pick up my brain for a few hours, <a
href="javascript:location.href = 'mailto:' + ['igor','konnov.phd'].join('@')"
aria-label="email">drop me an email.</a> After that, we can switch to a
messenger of your choice (e.g., Signal, Telegram, or others) or have a call. For
short consultations, I accept payments via Stripe. I also consider longer-term
engagements (from weeks to months), which would require a contract. You can see
my portfolio at <a href="https://konnov.phd">konnov.phd</a>. I am based in
Austria (CET/CEST) and have experience working with clients from the US, UK, and
EU.  </p>
