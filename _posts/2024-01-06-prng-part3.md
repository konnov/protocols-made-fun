This is Part 3 of a three-part blog post. If you have not read [Part 1][] and
[Part 2][], please do that first.

## 3. Testing and Checking the Properties

Now it is time to check our properties! We will use two Quint commands:

 - `quint run` that runs the randomized simulator,
 - `quint verify` that runs the model checker [Apalache][].

If you wish to reproduce the experiments, use the specification [prng2.qnt][].

### 3.1. Testing the Properties with the Simulator

To test both properties, we simply use `quint run`:

```sh
$ quint run --invariant=safety ./specs/prng2.qnt
An example execution:

[State 0] { base: 1, bound: 3724719, input: 3724719, output: 0, pc: InLoop }
[State 1] { base: 256, bound: 3724719, input: 14549, output: 110, pc: InLoop }
[State 2] { base: 65536, bound: 3724719, input: 56, output: 28236, pc: InLoop }
[State 3] { base: 65536, bound: 3724719, input: 56, output: 618060, pc: Done }

[ok] No violation found (1248ms).

$ quint run --invariant=missingOutput ./specs/prng2.qnt
An example execution:

[State 0] { base: 1, bound: 7132656, input: 7132656, output: 0, pc: InLoop }
[State 1] { base: 256, bound: 7132656, input: 27861, output: 46, pc: InLoop }
[State 2] { base: 65536, bound: 7132656, input: 108, output: 11795, pc: InLoop }
[State 3] { base: 65536, bound: 7132656, input: 108, output: 2895379, pc: Done }

[ok] No violation found (1288ms).
```

In both cases, the simulator has exercised 10,000 random executions. This is the
default setting that we can change by setting `--max=samples` e.g. to 1,000,000.

:raising_hand: Does it mean that both properties hold true? Not exactly.
Similar to property-based testing, the simulator reports a property violation,
if it finds one. However, if the simulator does not find a bug, all we know is
that the executions tried by the simulator, e.g., 1,000,000 executions, do not
violate the invariants.

Of course, we can always increase the number of executions. We have to be aware
though that the simulation times are increasing linearly with the number of
executions. See the plot for the both invariants below.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/prng2-times.png" width="75%">

:raising_hand: How many executions shall we enumerate, to be completely sure
that the invariant `missingOutput` holds true? Since we have fixed $bound$ to
`0xff0001`, we know the following:

 - Action `init` produces one state under the assumption that $bound$ equals to
   `0xff0001`.

 - Action `loop` is executed exactly two times. Each time, this action
   non-deterministically chooses a value in the interval $[0,
   \texttt{WORD_BOUND})$.

 - Action `postLoop` is executed once. It non-deterministically chooses a
   value in the interval $[0, \texttt{WORD_BOUND})$.

Hence, for $bound = \texttt{0xff0001}$, we have $\texttt{WORD_BOUND}^3$
executions. Under the assumption of $\texttt{WORD_BOUND}=2^8$, we have $2^{24}$
executions! This is about 17 million executions. According to our plot,
enumerating all these executions would take about 1 hour, even though we would
have to distinguish visited executions from unvisited executions somehow. In
case of $\texttt{WORD_BOUND}=2^{32}$, we would have $2^{96}$ executions. That's
really a lot!

### 3.2. Checking the Properties with Apalache

It would be great, if we could check the invariants against *all* executions at
once. This is exactly what a model checker does[^1].

[^1]: This statement comes with a caveat: By default Apalache checks *all* executions of length up to 10 steps.

**Checking Property (1).** Let's run the model checker:

```sh
$ quint verify --invariant=safety specs/prng2.qnt

An example execution:

[State 0] { base: 1, bound: 16777216, input: 16777216, output: 0, pc: InLoop }
[State 1] { base: 256, bound: 16777216, input: 65536, output: 255, pc: InLoop }
[State 2]
{ base: 65536, bound: 16777216, input: 256, output: 65535, pc: InLoop }
[State 3]
{ base: 16777216, bound: 16777216, input: 1, output: 16777215, pc: InLoop }
[State 4]
{ base: 16777216, bound: 16777216, input: 1, output: 16777215, pc: Done }

[violation] Found an issue (430ms).
error: reached a deadlock
```

The model checker comes back almost immediately by saying that it had found a
deadlock. What does it mean? The model checker has found an execution that
cannot be continued. If you look at [the diagram][] and the example
execution, it actually makes sense: We have reached a state where `pc == Done`.
By default, the model checker does not assume that it has to deal with a
terminating state machine. If we were specifying a concurrent system, then the
inability to continue an execution could indicate a serious design flaw.

In our case, we expect executions to terminate. Hence, we should instruct the
model checker to ignore deadlocks. The easiest way to do that is by passing
a configuration file to Apalache. Below, I am using [no-deadlocks.json][]:

```
$ quint verify --apalache-config=specs/no-deadlocks.json --invariant=safety specs/prng2.qnt
[ok] No violation found (170ms).
```

This time, the model checker tells us that it could not find a violation. Is it
for real? By default Apalache checks *all* executions of length up to 10 steps.
Since the action `loop` is executed up to two times
(remember, that we have set `MAX_NWORDS` to 3), all executions contain up to
four actions under our current parameters. In other words, all executions
belong to one of the four shapes:

```quint
init.then(postLoop)
init.then(loop).then(postLoop)
init.then(loop).then(loop).then(postLoop)
```

:information_source: The above expressions are real Quint expressions, which
define [Runs][]. You can try them in REPL.

Knowing that our runs are composed of up to four actions and Apalache checks
all executions up to 10 steps, we obtain a pretty solid *proof* that the
invariant `safety` holds true :ballot_box_with_check:. We could even use
Apalache to show that all executions are indeed having at most 4 steps under
`MAX_NWORDS=3`, but this post is already too long.

Notice that Apalache has checked the invariant in 170ms. That was blazing fast
in comparison to the simulator. On top of that, we have got much better
guarantees! I was running `quint verify` with Apalache being bootstrapped
already. If you simply run `quint verify`, it will bootstrap Apalache, which
takes 3-4 seconds.

After running Apalache, we know that my initial hypothesis about `safety` being
broken does not hold true. :raising_hand: Does it make the generator correct?
Not yet. We still have Property (2) to check.

**Checking Property (2).** Recall that in [Section 2.4][] (Part 2) we have found out
that if the invariant `missingOutput` holds true, then Property (2) is
violated. Let's check that with Apalache:

```sh
$ quint verify --apalache-config=specs/no-deadlocks.json \
  --invariant=missingOutput specs/prng2.qnt
[ok] No violation found (163ms).
```

The invariant holds true :ballot_box_with_check:. If we look at the invariant
`missingOutput` again, what we have *proved* with Apalache is that whenever
$bound$ is set to `0xff0001`, the variable $output$ is never assigned the value
`0xff0000`. This definitely goes against our expectation in Property (2)
:beetle:.

Again, it took Apalache 163ms to show that the invariant holds true.
With the simulator, we would not be able to show that at all!

## 4. Root Cause Analysis

Why is it impossible to generate $output = \texttt{0xff0000}$ when $bound$ is
set to `0xff0001`? One way is to stare at the specification and try to find the
reason. Another way is to interactively play with the specification. This is
what we can do with REPL. We manually initialize the state machine with $bound$
set to `0xff0001` and replay several steps in the hope of finding the root
cause:

```
$ quint -r specs/prng2.qnt::prng2
>>> all { bound' = 0xff0001, input' = 0xff0001, output' = 0, base' = 1, pc' = InLoop }
true
>>> step
true
>>> step
true
>>> step
true
>>> pc
Done
>>> input
255
```

Here we are! We cannot generate `255` (or `0xff` in hex) to be the most
significant word, as `input == 255` and we have the following line in the
specification:

```quint
  output' = (generated % input) * base + output,
```

If we look at the TypeScript code, this is no mistake made in translation:

```ts
  output = (squares64(state) % input) * base + output
```

That we take modulo `input` is the root cause of the problem.

We could try to quickly patch this line as follows:

```quint
  output' = (generated % (input + 1)) * base + output,
```

However, this would break the invariant `safety`, which would be easy to find
with the model checker. This code needs a proper fix, which I will probably
discuss in another blog post :leftwards_arrow_with_hook:.

## 5. Impact Analysis

Now that we know that Property (1) is satisfied, whereas Property (2) does not
hold true, we have to understand the impact of Property (2) being violated. How
serious is it?  We have one data point, for which the PRNG never produces one
`output` value below the bound. Once we have found the root cause of the problem,
we could find more data points that confirm it.

Since the PRNG is used by the simulator, it means that the simulator never
explores certain states of a state machine. As a result, for certain
specifications it would never be able to reach certain states that violate a
state invariant. In this context, "never" means "never". There are no
probabilities involved. This is usually called *incompleteness*.

As we have discussed, in contrast to the model checker, the simulator would not
be able to explore all executions in practical cases. Hence, it is not a
serious failure in the logic of this feature.

## 6. Conclusions

My first blog post happened to be so long that I broke it down into three
parts. In the future, I will write shorter ones. My goal was to demonstrate you
how to write specifications and use tools to quickly reason about them without
going back to pen and paper, or a whiteboard. In practical terms, our
specification is quite small. However, it exhibits my most favorite feature of
$\tla{}$ and Quint, namely, non-determinism.

I hope you found this text entertaining. If you do, please upvote the [Github
discussion][], leave a comment there, star the repo, etc. It is important to me
to see, whether anyone is curious about this topic and I should keep writing
about it.

I have mentioned $\tla{}$ in this post multiple times. Showing the $\tla{}$
specification of the PRNG definitely deserves another blog post
:leftwards_arrow_with_hook:.
