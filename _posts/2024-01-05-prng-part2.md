This is Part 2 of a three-part blog post. If you have not read [Part 1][],
please do that first.

## 2. Specifying PRNG in Quint

Before we go into specification, we should ask ourselves several
questions:

 1. What concern does the specification address? For example, are we more
 worried about the code logic being flawed, or do we really have to figure
 out the distribution of our PRNG?

 1. Do we want to specify the code as is, or do we want to forget some
 "less important" pieces?

 1. Do we want to write a specification for arbitrarily-long integers,
 or, say, sequences up to ten 32-bit integers would suffice?

Since my goal is to understand, whether the generator logic is flawed, or not,
my answers to these questions are as follows:

 1. The specification should follow the code logic. Whether the generator's
 distribution is uniform is less important to me at the moment. It is crucial
 though that for every integer $i$ from the interval $[0, bound)$, the
 probability of producing $i$ is greater than 0. Also, the generator must
 produce values within the bounds.

 1. We do not care about the exact behavior of `square64`. However, it is
 important to me that `square64` generates all integers in the interval $[0,
 2^{32})$. This means that we want to replace `square64` with something more
 abstract. We will see how to do this below. Since the variable `state` only
 interacts with `square64`, we can simply drop this variable. What we are doing
 here is usually called an *overapproximation* of the behavior.

 1. It's fine to start with the specification of big integers that could be
 packed into up to three 32-bit words. By having three words, we can exercise
 up to two loop iterations, which should be the minimal interesting case.
 Actually, to ease the spec debugging, I would even start with 8-bit words
 instead of 32-bit. What we are doing here is usually called an
 *underapproximation* of the behavior. Importantly, we should write a
 specification in such a way that it would be easy to generalize it.

Usually, I am writing a protocol specification in several steps: Starting
with the most obvious parts and continuing with the most challenging ones.
In this post, we will do it the same way.

:warning: A lot of text follows. It actually took me maybe 15-30 minutes to
write a complete Quint specification and experiment with it. However,
presenting and understanding the thought process requires more effort.

### 2.1. Specifying the Control Loop

Following $\tla{}$, Quint is built around the concept of a state machine. If I
asked you to draw a state machine of the [PRNG code][], there is a
good chance that you would draw a diagram similar to the one below:

<a id="pc-diagram" />

<!-- once Github pages support mermaid, use img/prng1-control.mermaid -->

![Control diagram]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/prng1-control.png)

While this is not exactly the same state machine that $\tla{}$ experts would
have imagined, this is a good starting point. Basically, we initialize the
state machine, run it in a loop for a while, and, then, we are done. This is
what we specify in the first version: [prng1.qnt][].

For the readers unfamiliar with Quint, we introduce this specification in
smaller pieces that are easier to digest. The pieces to be defined later are
written in `<<<...>>>`.

```quint
module prng1 {
  type PC = | InLoop | Done
  var pc: PC

  <<<initialisation>>>

  <<<step>>>
}
```

Since the [PRNG code][] is single-threaded, we introduce one variable
`pc`, which stands for a *program counter*, similar to [Program counter][] in
hardware. Quint is a typed language, so we had to declare the type associated
with the variable `pc`, that is, the type `PC`. As a result, our variable `pc`
can be assigned one of the two values: `Loop` or `Done`. If you want to learn
more about the type declaration of `PC`, check [Sum Types][] in the Quint
language reference.

**Machine Initialisation.** This is how we initialize our state machine:

```quint
  action init: bool = {
    pc' = InLoop
  }
```

This part should be easy to understand. Once `init` is evaluated,
the variable `pc` has the value `InLoop`, as prescribed by `pc' = InLoop`.

**Machine Step.** Similar to the [the diagram][], we introduce the
action `step`, which non-deterministically chooses between two other actions:
`loop` and `postLoop`.

```quint
  action step = any {
    loop,
    postLoop,
  }

  <<<actions>>>
```

Finally, the actions `loop` and `postLoop` are defined as follows:

```quint
  action loop: bool = all {
    pc == InLoop,
    pc' = InLoop,
  }

  action postLoop: bool = all {
    pc == InLoop,
    pc' = Done,
  }
```

**Exercising the Machine.** Our specification is not very useful, but it's
not entirely useless either. We can play with it in REPL and convince ourselves
that it specifies the same behavior as shown in [the diagram][]:

```quint
$ quint -r specs/prng1.qnt::prng1
Quint REPL 0.17.1
Type ".exit" to exit, or ".help" for more information
>>> init
true
>>> pc
InLoop
>>> loop
true
>>> loop
true
>>> postLoop
true
>>> pc
Done
```

Once we have played enough with this specification, let's add the interesting
part to the state machine, that is, *data*.

### 2.2. Specifying Data Transformations

Now it is time to add data to [prng1.qnt][]. You can find a complete version of
this new specification in [prng2.qnt][]. Whereas the control part was pretty
straightforward, data requires a few curious tricks.

Following the [PRNG code][], we simply declare four new integer
variables, in addition to `PC`:

```quint
module prng2 {
  <<<values>>>

  type PC = | InLoop | Done
  var pc: PC
  var bound: int
  var input: int
  var output: int
  var base: int

  <<<initialisation>>>

  <<<step>>>
}
```

**Machine Initialisation.** When looking at the [PRNG code][], it
should be fairly obvious how to initialise the variables `input`, `output`, and
`base`. How do we initialise `bound` though? In the TypeScript code, `bound` is
actually a function parameter, so it may have multiple values, and we do not
have much control over which values it may receive. This sounds like a case for
data non-determinism.

In principle, we could just non-deterministically pick an arbitrary integer:

```quint
  nondet generated = Nat.oneOf()
  bound' = generated
```

However, we would have to deal with quite large integers when debugging the
specification. For the moment, I would like to work with 8-bit words and
restrict `bound` to at most three 8-bit words. Hence, I declare two immutable
values in the block `<<<values>>>` (called "pure values" in Quint):

```quint
  pure val WORD_BOUND: int = 2^8
  pure val MAX_NWORDS: int = 3
```

Once we have defined `WORD_BOUND` and `MAX_NWORDS`, we can easily write `init`:

```quint
  action init: bool = all {
    nondet generated = 1.to(WORD_BOUND^MAX_NWORDS).oneOf()
    all {
      bound' = generated,
      input' = generated,
    },
    output' = 0,
    base' = 1,
    pc' = InLoop,
  }
```

**Machine Step.** Now it is time to define the `loop` action for the loop.
Most of it is straightforward, except for the call to `squares64`, which we
omit for now:

```quint
  action loop: bool = all {
    pc == InLoop,
    input >= WORD_BOUND,
    <<<updateOutput>>>
    input' = input / WORD_BOUND,
    base' = base * WORD_BOUND,
    bound' = bound,
    pc' = InLoop,
  }
```

How do we update the output? Here is the line from the TypeScript code:

```ts
  output = output * U32 + squares64(state)
```

We know that `squares64` returns a new pseudo-random value based on the value
of `state`. The actual sequence of values produced by `squares64` is not that
important to us. Unless we really care about the actual distribution of values
produced by `squares64` (for the moment, we do not), we can replace `squares64`
with non-determinism:

```quint
    nondet generated = 0.to(WORD_BOUND - 1).oneOf()
    output' = output * WORD_BOUND + generated,
```

If you remember that the Quint simulator interprets `oneOf` as random choice,
this looks silly: We have replaced one PRNG with another! There is a bit more
to that. We will run the model checker later, and it will not have any
assumptions about the value distribution. What we did here is actually *an
abstraction*: We have replaced a very specific PRNG with logic that encompasses
all PRNGs.

:information_source: What we did is somewhat similar to abstraction in
programming languages. For instance, in TypeScript, we could have introduced an
interface for a PRNG and declare that `squares64` implements this interface.
*Beware!* This is where the analogy ends. Interfaces in mainstream programming
languages are purely syntactic. As soon as your implementation meets the
syntactic requirements that is, the type signatures match, the compiler would
consider your implementation to be compatible with the interface. Our
abstraction is not *syntactic* but *semantic*: We have replaced a concrete PRNG
with an abstract PRNG that encompasses the behavior of all possible PRNGs. To
be completely precise here, I would have to *prove* that `squares64` does
indeed generate values in the interval $[0, \texttt{WORD_BOUND})$. Here I am
saying that it is obvious, which is a hand-waiving argument. Perhaps, I will
show how to do that in a different blog post :leftwards_arrow_with_hook:.

:warning: If you have skimmed through the last two paragraphs, I recommend you
to read them again. What we have done with `squares64` is pretty important,
even though it was not complicated. Developing intuition about which parts of
the code should remain unabstracted and which parts of the code should be
abstracted is one of the most important skills in specification writing.

Having understood how to specify `loop`, we can easily write `postLoop` by
following the same idea of abstraction:

```quint
  action postLoop: bool = all {
    pc == InLoop,
    input < WORD_BOUND,
    nondet generated = 0.to(WORD_BOUND - 1).oneOf()
    output' = (generated % input) * base + output,
    input' = input,
    base' = base,
    bound' = bound,
    pc' = Done,
  }
```

### 2.3. Playing with the Specification

This is an important part of specification writing. Similar to writing a
program, once you have some parts of your specification working, you should run
them and see what happens. Of course, we could exercise `init` and `step` in
REPL. But at some point, it gets too tedious. Instead of doing that, we can
also run the simulator and observe the examples it is producing:

```sh
$ quint run --max-samples=1 specs/prng2.qnt
An example execution:

[State 0] { base: 1, bound: 7098000, input: 7098000, output: 0, pc: InLoop }
[State 1] { base: 256, bound: 7098000, input: 27726, output: 181, pc: InLoop }
[State 2] { base: 65536, bound: 7098000, input: 108, output: 46427, pc: InLoop }
[State 3] { base: 65536, bound: 7098000, input: 108, output: 505179, pc: Done }

[ok] No violation found (64ms).
```

Since I wanted to look at the examples, I constrained the simulator to try
exactly one run (by setting `--max-samples=1`). By running the simulator
multiple times and comparing the values to what I expected, I get a bit of
confidence in my specification.

Although the simulator writes that no violation was found, there was not much
opportunity for the simulator to find bugs. To do something more meaningful,
we have to specify the expected properties.

If I was writing a program, this is where the story would end. Perhaps, I
would have written a few unit tests to make sure that the code does not break
in the future. When it comes to specifications, this is the moment, when
the real game starts! :video_game:

### 2.4. Specifying the Expected Properties

Recall that I had expressed two expected properties earlier:

 1. The generator always produces values within the bounds.

 1. For every integer $i$ from the interval $[0, bound)$, the probability of
 producing $i$ is greater than 0.

**Property (1).** This property is a *state invariant*: It should hold in every
reachable state of our state machine. We can easily write it like follows:

```quint
  val safety = (output >= 0) and (output < bound)
```

We will see how to check this invariant later.

**Property (2).** This property is not as easy to write. To begin with, similar
to $\tla{}$, Quint does not support probabilistic properties out of the box.
Luckily, we only require the probability to be different from zero. Hence, we
can informally rewrite Property (2) as follows:

*Property (2')*: (For *every* $bound$) for *every* integer $i$ from the interval
$[0, bound)$, there *exists* a future state in which $output = i$ holds true.

The above formulation looks better. Indeed, there are no probabilities.
However, there is no way to write this property in Quint either. Following
$\tla{}$, Quint allows the user to specify properties of all possible
behaviors. Hence, every temporal property in Quint, as well as in $\tla{}$, has
an implicit universal quantifier over all executions. It is possible to specify
our property in Computation Tree Logic ([CTL][]). There are tools such as
[nuXmv][] that reason about CTL, but Quint is not one of them. Perhaps, trying
nuXmv on this example is a good topic for another blog post
:leftwards_arrow_with_hook:.

Is it game over :space_invader:? Not exactly. If we negate Property (2'), then
we will see that we can talk about all futures again:

*Property (2'')*: There *exists* $bound$ and there *exists* an integer $i$ from the
interval $[0, bound)$ such that *for all* executions, *for all* future states,
it holds that $output \ne i$.

This looks close to $\tla{}$ and Linear Temporal Logic (see [LTL][]), which
allow us to reason about all executions. Perhaps, it would be even more
obvious, if I was writing these properties in a temporal logic. However, I
would maintain them in English to keep things simple (even though less
precise).  If you wonder how I came up with Property (2''), I actually took a
formal negation of the logic formula in $\tla{}$ :wink:.

Let us fix $bound$ to be `0xff0001` and $i$ to be `0xff0000` and write the
following state invariant:

```quint
  val missingOutput = {
    (pc == Done and bound == 0xff0001) implies (output != 0xff0000)
  }
```

If we prove that $missingOutput$ is an invariant of our specification, then we
would know that we have disproved Property (2) by providing a counterexample to
this property. *Here should be a cliff hanger...* I am not going to keep you in
suspense until the next week. This is exactly the invariant I have *proved*
with [Apalache][] to demonstrate that my [PRNG code][] was flawed :beetle:.

It only remains to see how we *automatically* check Properties (1)-(2).

## To be continued...
